This project was created as a final submission to the MIT Many Intersting Things Program led by Sufian Aldogom. Using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding, I have created a website to display my final project. Along with that is my face/eye detection program. Using the OpenCV library, Python, and the concept of cascading, gray scaling, and more, I created a program that detects the movement of your face and eyes. I plan to expand on this in the future and work towards making this a facial recognition system.
